<h1>ToqiNet<h1>
<h2>Model Overview</h2>

<p>ToqiNet is an advanced deep learning model tailored for image classification tasks. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from input images and make accurate predictions about their respective classes. In this section, we'll explore how ToqiNet works and delve into its underlying algorithms and functionality.</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>

<p>ToqiNet operates by processing input images through a series of convolutional and pooling layers to extract meaningful features. These features are then fed into fully connected layers for classification. Let's break down the key components of ToqiNet's functionality:</p>

<h4>Convolutional Layers</h4>

<p>The convolutional layers in ToqiNet serve as feature extractors, detecting patterns and shapes within the input images. Each convolutional layer applies a set of learnable filters to the input, producing feature maps that highlight relevant spatial information.</p>

<h4>Pooling Layers</h4>

<p>Pooling layers in ToqiNet reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers. This helps in capturing the most salient features while discarding redundant information, leading to more efficient processing and improved generalization.</p>

<h4>Fully Connected Layers</h4>

<p>The fully connected layers in ToqiNet take the flattened feature vectors from the preceding layers and perform classification based on learned representations. These layers enable ToqiNet to make predictions about the input images' classes with high accuracy.</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>Behind the scenes, ToqiNet employs sophisticated algorithms to optimize model performance and enhance training efficiency. Let's explore some of the key algorithms used in ToqiNet:</p>

<h4>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</h4>

<p>ToqiNet utilizes SGD as the optimization algorithm to iteratively update the model parameters based on the gradients computed from mini-batches of training data. SGD helps ToqiNet converge towards optimal parameter values and improves its ability to generalize to unseen data.</p>

<h4>Cross-Entropy Loss</h4>

<p>ToqiNet employs cross-entropy loss as the objective function to measure the discrepancy between the predicted class probabilities and the ground truth labels. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss during training, ToqiNet learns to make more accurate predictions and achieve higher classification accuracy.</p>

<h2>Training and Evaluation</h2>

<p>To train ToqiNet, we utilize labeled image datasets and follow a standard training procedure:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Iterate over the training dataset in mini-batches, computing predictions, calculating loss, and updating model parameters using backpropagation.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization capability.</li>
</ol>
